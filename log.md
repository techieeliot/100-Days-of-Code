### Day 2: August 2, 2019
#####

**Today's Progress**: I worked through the beautiful blog Scrimba course for the freeCodeCamp Jackson, MS build-a-blog workshop.

**Thoughts:** I'm a little overwhelmed that the workshop is tomorrow and worried that I won't be prepared enough for the grid section.

**Today's Progress**: The workshop went super well, and we were able to get through HTML, CSS basics, CSS Flexbox, and CSS Grid.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited about the result of the workshop. People were seriously learning about basic frontend web development for the first times in their lives all because of our group. It was a turning point kind of moment for our fledgling band of code newbies.

### Day 4: August 4, 2019
#####

**Today's Progress**: Standup with w3develops react study group members to discuss the hack-a-thon project. We discussed the Routes, API's, Logic, Models, and Views of the Banking App Concept.

**Thoughts:** I wish I would have gotten to more programming, but we discussed the architectural design of an app.

### Day 5: August 5, 2019
#####

**Today's Progress**: Worked through Chapter 2 of the MongoDB Basics Course, but I realized that I won't complete the assignments and need to restart tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I'm a little dejected that I didn't reach my goal, but I'm glad that they have a rolling admissions to the course. MDB is really an amazing company. It's unbelievable that I missed the boat on investing in this company at 82.

### Day 6: August 6, 2019
#####

**Today's Progress**: Restarted MongoDB course, so I'll be able to pass the course. Openned the Movie App Udemy course, but didn't get much done.

**Thoughts:** Felt little because I didn't achieve my targets and was not on top of my tasks like others in the study group that are really doing well.
