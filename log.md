**Today's Progress**: I worked through the beautiful blog Scrimba course for the freeCodeCamp Jackson, MS build-a-blog workshop.

**Thoughts:** I'm a little overwhelmed that the workshop is tomorrow and worried that I won't be prepared enough for the grid section.

**Today's Progress**: The workshop went super well, and we were able to get through HTML, CSS basics, CSS Flexbox, and CSS Grid.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited about the result of the workshop. People were seriously learning about basic frontend web development for the first times in their lives all because of our group. It was a turning point kind of moment for our fledgling band of code newbies.
