**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp Basic Javascript with JS-Study-Group worked through challeges 12 to 17 with Mesfin and Kara. We went over the basics of git and github with Kara.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good about the progress though it was short in fcc today. Was listening to the Les Miserables soundtrack and got pumped up about MagnoliaJS coming up this week.
