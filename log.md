### Day 1: February 27, 2019
#####

**Today's Progress**: Two days ago I met with a client about making a solution to a purchase order problem for a small furniture manufacturer. I assembled a team of a GUI designer and a lead php developer. I'm the project manager and client liasion. We met as a team together or separately three times today to discus our project. Jana and I coded in basic javascript on freecodecamp from lesson 1 through Global Scope and Functions. I discussed the web application project with Ebi my designer and Barry my lead developer. We discusssed the word document templates and the route to creating our database and the schedule, style build sheets, and bandsaw sheets. I discussed the project with a few of my mentors. 

**Thoughts:** I'm really in over my head with this project. I want to speed the whole night learning php. The journal entries method is really cool. I look forward to documenting my progress toward becoming a full stack software engineer.

### Day 3: March 1, 2019
#####

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp with Ebi and Jana through introducing else statements in Basic Javascript. We went in the console on chrome and played around with global variables and functions with if else statements. In the evening I attended the techstars startup weekend opening night event, and I'm part of the "Life Cloud" team under Deanna with Matt Cox and Soden Ka.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed today's a.m. meeting. We had fun encouraging each other and the group is really coming together. The startup week was fun, and I enjoyed standing in front of room and pitching my idea.

### Day 4: March #, 2019
#####

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp Basic Javascript with Jana worked up to Chaining If Else Statements lesson. Slept in a little bit after staying up late for Techstars Startup Weekend.

**Thoughts:** Today was a feel good moment where I felt really good about the conversation that I had with Jana and the future looks great working with him. Also, the day was very long at the Innovate Mississippi Office working out the details of the Life Cloud Vault startup.
